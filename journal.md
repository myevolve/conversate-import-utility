## Working Version Analysis (commit 0fe9cfa)

### Store Implementation
1. Clean state management
   - Uses Zustand with persist middleware
   - Proper auth state handling
   - Clear account/inbox selection flow

2. API Implementation
   - Correct base URL handling
   - Proper auth header management
   - Clean error handling
   - No unnecessary headers

### Key Differences from Current Version
1. Base URL handling
   - Working: `typeof window === "undefined" ? "https://app.conversate.us" : "/api"`
   - Current: Direct URL without proxy

2. Auth Header Management
   - Working: Uses cookies and headers properly
   - Current: Mixed usage causing issues

3. State Management
   - Working: Clean state updates with proper error handling
   - Current: Overcomplicated with unnecessary state updates

## Action Items
1. Revert API changes to use proxy setup
2. Restore working auth header management
3. Simplify state management
4. Keep DB connection for labels only

## Test Files Analysis

### Working Test Files
1. test-import.sh
   - Working shell script that tests the full import flow
   - Handles login, auth tokens, and file upload
   - Uses test-import.csv for data

2. test-contacts.csv
   - Working test data file
   - Contains valid contact data with proper formatting
   - Used for basic import testing

3. test-labels-import.csv
   - Working test data file
   - Contains valid contact data with labels
   - Used for testing label import functionality

### Test Files Needing Review
1. test-api-auth.mjs
   - Currently failing with 401 error
   - Needs to be updated with correct credentials
   - Moved to broken_test_files

2. test-single-contact.json
   - Format looks correct but needs validation
   - Similar to other working JSON files
   - Keep in working_test_files for now

3. test-labels-validation.json
   - Contains mix of valid and invalid labels
   - Used for testing label validation
   - Keep in working_test_files

4. test-import-labels.json
   - Similar format to test-labels-validation.json
   - Used for testing label import
   - Keep in working_test_files

5. test-import-with-labels.json
   - Almost identical to test-import-labels.json
   - Possible duplicate
   - Move to broken_test_files for review

## Current Issues
1. Auth not working in test-api-auth.mjs
2. Possible duplicate test files for label testing
3. Need to verify label validation logic matches test data

## Next Steps
1. Fix test-api-auth.mjs with correct credentials
2. Consolidate duplicate label test files
3. Verify label validation against test data
4. Update UI to match working test cases
